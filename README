Droidaroo is an attempt to create an Android app to view the Bonnaroo 2010 music festival schedule.

This is my first real exposure to android/java/json/sql so it is very much a work in progress. YMMV etc

Brief overview of contents:
  scraper: creates an sqlite3 db of schedule data scraped from bonnaroo.com
    venues.txt: raw JSON data copied from http://mindreader.bonnaroo.com/bonnaroo-2010-schedule.html
    events.txt: raw JSON data copied from http://mindreader.bonnaroo.com/bonnaroo-2010-schedule.html
    parser.py: uses demjson to decode the JSON and write it into an sqlite3 DB in ../droidaroo/res/raw/eventdb
  droidaroo: contains the android project itself

Tested on a motorola droid running 2.1
Developed with the 2.1 sdk with a 1.5 target

"python parser.py" must be run from ./scraper to populate db before running the android project

If eclipse is not recognizing the phone, try running:
sudo /home/brian/android/tools/adb kill-server
sudo /home/brian/android/tools/adb start-server
