Droidaroo is an attempt to create an Android app to view the Bonnaroo 2010 music festival schedule.

This is my first real exposure to android/java/json/sql so it is very much a work in progress. YMMV etc

Brief overview of contents:
  scraper: creates an sqlite3 db of schedule data scraped from bonnaroo.com
    venues.txt: raw JSON data copied from http://mindreader.bonnaroo.com/bonnaroo-2010-schedule.html
    events.txt: raw JSON data copied from http://mindreader.bonnaroo.com/bonnaroo-2010-schedule.html
    parser.py: uses demjson to decode the JSON and write it into an sqlite3 DB in ../droidaroo/res/raw/eventdb
  droidaroo: contains the android project itself

Tested on a motorola droid running 2.1
Developed with the 2.1 sdk with a 1.5 target

"python scraper.py" must be run from ./scraper to populate db before running the android project

If eclipse is not recognizing the phone, try running:
sudo /home/brian/android/tools/adb kill-server
sudo /home/brian/android/tools/adb start-server

TODO:
Refactor activities: may only need one menu activity, one eventList activity, and one detailedListing activity
Detailed listings when you click on a result (all shows by that band, wiki link, pic, etc...)
Shows by day
Options/settings activities (home button, search button...)
Restrict search to certain stages (or toggle between main stage listing and all stage listings?)
Persistent settings
Auto-Scroll list to current time
Show time in friendlier formats (am/pm, 28 minutes from now, 2 hours ago, colorcoded past/future)
Search
Map (scroll, zoom, pinch zoom?)
Icon
Update db capability or host it remotely
Make a custom schedule/notifications
Get on market
